# binance-firefly-iii

As there's not just one exchange out there, and the basics of trade data are pretty the same binance-firefly-iii quickly had to make place for [crypto-trades-firefly-iii](https://github.com/financelurker/crypto-trades-firefly-iii).

See [here](./README.old.md) for the old documentation of this service.
